## Introduction

The CatBot is a home robot designed for pets, with the ability to dispense treats and play with the pet. The best part? It can be controlled with an user interface from anywhere in the world. The CatBot uses Raspberry Pi 4 to interface over the web, and sends all of the control signals to the Mbed. 

This final project was created by students from the Georgia Institute of Technology for ECE 4180: Embedded Systems Design.
